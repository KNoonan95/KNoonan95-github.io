<div class="padtext"><p>My favourite language is C++ but I am also able to make use of Java, Python, C, Ruby, Javascript, HTML, etc.
I received my education in Computer Science from the Bachelor of Science degree at the University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland. I graduated in 2018 
and have been working in industry since. The modules in my final years gave me a well rounded foundation in all major technology areas and I
hope to continue to grow as a general computer scientist capable of full-stack develoment in all environments. Programming languages, hardware, proprietary 
software, these are all just tools , best suited to their particular contexts, and I aim to apply the best tool to the job. I enjoy learning
new technologies, but I also hope to hone my existing skillset as well. 

Below is my home town of Ballina, Co. Tipperary. In Irish it is BÃ©al an Atha (Mouth of the Ford) as in sight, to the right hand side where the 
river narrows is a ford. One I intend to do a later blog post on, as it has seen a ton of exciting history.</p></div>
