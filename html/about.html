      I received my education in Computer Science from the Bachelor of Science degree at the University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland. The modules in my final years gave me a well rounded foundation in all major technology areas and I
      hope to continue to grow as a general computer scientist capable of full-stack develoment in all environments. Programming languages, hardware, proprietary 
      software, these are all just tools , best suited to their particular contexts, and I aim to apply the best tool to the job. I graduated in 2018 
      and have been working in industry since. 
      <br>
      My favourite programming language is C++ but I am also able to make use of Java, Python, C, Ruby, Javascript, HTML, etc.
      I enjoy learning new technologies, but I also hope to hone my existing skillset as well.

      Below is my home town of Ballina, Co. Tipperary. In Irish it is BÃ©al an Atha (Mouth of the Ford) as in sight, to the right hand side where the 
      river narrows is a ford. One I intend to do a later blog post on, as it has seen a ton of exciting history.

      I have for the last four years worked for Jaguar Land Rover as a Software Engineer on numerous
        cutting edge projects in the embedded and security/cloud space. Developing R&D and production level C++ software, as well
        as using Python for scripting/simulation. Over my time I got to work with numerous hardware vendors and proprietary software tools
        and I have become proficcient in evaluating tools and hardware, as well as the best programming language.
