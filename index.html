  <p class="text-center"> My intent is to create a brief portfolio here, of some of my favourite CS projects as well as some 
    blog posts and the occassional (or more than occasional) picture of my dog Hugo, and potentially me.
    In addition I will have some posts concerning general history and sites of interest, perhaps the odd book reccomendation 
    or two. While the CS projects are plenty of fun by themselves, a diversity of interest never hurts. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>In studying for my BSc in Computer Science I attended the University College Dublin. insert info about the university
        My final year project was <strong> "A framework for the systematic comparison of robot adaptation abilities in simulated 
        environments"</strong> which while a mouthful was an extremely enjoyable project in which I had the opportunity to 
        demonstrate my ability to embrace a large codebase, and build upon it with extended features, user oriented and which 
        reduced the complexity of interface. Using the Simbad robot generator I was able to build a framework which compared 
        the "runs" of robots in a simulated maze environment. These robots were programmed with various algorithms 
        by which they would traverse the maze. {close paragraph and link to project page on the framework}  </p>
