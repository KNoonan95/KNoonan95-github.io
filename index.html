  <h2> My name is Kevin Noonan. </h2>
  <hr>
  
  <p> My intent is to create a brief portfolio of some of my CS projects as well as some 
    blog posts and the occassional (or more than occasional) picture of my dog Hugo, and potentially me.
    In addition I will have some posts concerning History and sites of interest, perhaps the odd book or two.
    While the CS projects are plenty of fun, a bit of diversity never hurts. </p>
